# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make Falconrock Consulting branding more prominent on the Home page and replace the header logo with a new Falconrock logo.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate and add a new static Falconrock logo asset to `frontend/public/assets/generated` for use across the site.
- Replace the current top-left header logo with the new Falconrock logo while keeping the existing header company name/tagline intact.
- Update the Home hero section to feature “Falconrock Consulting” more prominently and display the new logo in the hero area without breaking mobile/desktop layout.

**User-visible outcome:** The site header and Home page hero clearly display Falconrock Consulting branding, with the new Falconrock logo shown in the header and alongside a more prominent “Falconrock Consulting” on the Home page.
