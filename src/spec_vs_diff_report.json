  "summary": "The diff adds a frontend slug generation/validation utility and uses it in frontend branding config with a runtime console check, but it does not show the requested update to the deployment-facing project name/slug source in project_state.json. As a result, the core fix intended to unblock deployment via the project’s deployment slug appears incomplete.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Update the project’s deployment-facing name/slug source so it generates a valid domain label (5–50 characters; only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens) and does not include parentheses, plus signs, spaces, or non-ASCII hyphen characters.",
      "reason": "The diff updates frontend branding to compute a deploymentSlug, but does not provide evidence that the actual deployment-facing name/slug source used by the deployment system was changed. No deployment config/source-of-truth change is shown outside frontend runtime logging.",

      "requirement": "In project_state.json, change the value that is currently used as the project name (\"Falconrock Consulting (virtualization + on‑prem IA for government contracts)\") to a slug-safe value that meets the domain/slug constraints.",
      "reason": "No evidence in the provided diff summary shows the project name value in project_state.json being changed to a slug-safe string; the truncated snippet still contains non-ASCII hyphen usage (\"on‑prem\") and parentheses in descriptive text, suggesting the problematic content may remain.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses on fixing deployment failure by updating the deployment-facing name/slug source (and explicitly updating project_state.json). Adding a non-blocking runtime console validator is not requested as part of the fix.",
