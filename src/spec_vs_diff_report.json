The backend includes inquiry submission and admin-only listing/detail methods, but persistent storage across upgrades is not evidenced, and the stored timestamp field name does not match the requested `createdAt`. The diff also introduces several features and mechanisms not requested (user profiles, admin secret-token initialization, and branding/footer attribution).",
